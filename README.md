# Decentralized Hiring Platform

This is a web3 application built on top of ethereum, which allows users to share and browse resumes, and if they like any, they can communicate with each other, while still being fully anonymous. Yes you can chat with yourself as well, because that's convenient.

This project is live at: https://dhir3.netlify.app/
